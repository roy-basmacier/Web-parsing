# Web-parsing

 Registering for a course in Sabanci is like playing the lottery (courses fill up too fast and they have too little capacity and no waitlist). 
 I developed a script that notifies students when their desired courses have room for registration.

 It works by selecting a term followed by a selection of chosen course numbers. 

 The script continuously checks Sabanci's website where they display information about the remaining capacity for the given courses. 

## When there are available slots, it notifies the student via SMS.


# Future adaptations: 
 Automatically register for a course when the available slot is ready.
 Notify users via mail or other methods of communication.
